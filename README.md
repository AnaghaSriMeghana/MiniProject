# Student Enrollment Form 

## Description

This project is a **Student Enrollment Form** built using HTML, JavaScript (jQuery), and **JSONPowerDB** as the backend database. The form allows users to input student details like roll number, full name, class, birth date, address, and enrollment date. It interacts with **JSONPowerDB** for real-time storage and retrieval of student data, enabling quick saving and updating of records. The form validates required fields and automatically switches between **Save** and **Update** modes depending on whether the studentâ€™s data already exists in the database.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 3), JavaScript (jQuery)
- **Backend:** JSONPowerDB (JPDB)
- **API:** RESTful API for database interactions (GET, PUT requests)
